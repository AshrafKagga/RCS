To highlight a present day in a calendar using JavaScript, you can use the `Date` object to get the current date and then update the corresponding element in the calendar. Here's an example:

```javascript
// Get the current date
const today = new Date();

// Get the day, month, and year
const day = today.getDate();
const month = today.getMonth() + 1; // Note: January is 0
const year = today.getFullYear();

// Find the corresponding element in the calendar
const element = document.querySelector(`[data-date="${year}-${month}-${day}"]`);

// Update the element to indicate that it's the present day
element.classList.add('present-day');
```

In this example, we first create a new `Date` object to get the current date. We then extract the day, month, and year from this object. Next, we use `querySelector` to find the element in the calendar that corresponds to the current date (assuming that each element in the calendar has a `data-date` attribute that matches the format `YYYY-MM-DD`). Finally, we add a CSS class (`present-day`) to this element to indicate that it's the present day.
